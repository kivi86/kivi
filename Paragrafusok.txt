<p1>Attack<br><br>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be spearers or smashers.</p2>
<p2>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p2>
<br>

<p3>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p3>

 <p4>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized light, and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p4>
